    """
    Checks all IAM managed policies resources in a CloudFormation file for any actions that are using a wilcard.
    See [current blacklisted roles](https://github.com/Skyscanner/cfripper/blob/master/cfripper/config/config.py#L26).

    Risk:
        The principle of least privilege (POLP), an important concept in computer security, is the
        practice of limiting access rights for users to the bare minimum permissions they need to
        perform their work.

    Fix:
        Do not use a wildcard on resources for actions that are in the blacklist. The example below
        shows a compliant policy, and in the code comments, an example of a non-compliant policy.

    Code for fix:
        Managed policy ARNs can also be dangerous and allow more privilege to a service than required. These should be avoided:
